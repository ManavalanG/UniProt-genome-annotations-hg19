DI-01181	Alpha-thalassemia	A-THAL	A form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of alpha-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. The level of alpha chain production can range from none to very nearly normal levels. Deletion of both copies of each of the two alpha-globin genes causes alpha(0)-thalassemia, also known as homozygous alpha thalassemia. Due to the complete absence of alpha chains, the predominant fetal hemoglobin is a tetramer of gamma-chains (Bart hemoglobin) that has essentially no oxygen carrying capacity. This causes oxygen starvation in the fetal tissues leading to prenatal lethality or early neonatal death. The loss of two alpha genes results in mild alpha-thalassemia, also known as heterozygous alpha-thalassemia. Affected individuals have small red cells and a mild anemia (microcytosis). If three of the four alpha-globin genes are functional, individuals are completely asymptomatic. Some rare forms of alpha-thalassemia are due to point mutations (non-deletional alpha-thalassemia).

Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens.

DI-01473	Darier disease	DD	A skin disorder characterized by warty papules and plaques in seborrheic areas (central trunk, flexures, scalp and forehead), palmoplantar pits and distinctive nail abnormalities. It is due to loss of adhesion between epidermal cells (acantholysis) and abnormal keratinization. Patients with mild disease may have no more than a few scattered keratotic papules or subtle nail changes, whereas those with severe disease are handicapped by widespread malodorous keratotic plaques. Some patients present with hemorrhage into acantholytic vesicles on the palms and dorsal aspects of the fingers which gives rise to black macules. In a few families affected by Darier disease, neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as mild mental retardation, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and epilepsy have been reported. Stress, UV exposure, heat, sweat, friction and oral contraception exacerbate disease symptoms. Clinical variants of Darier disease include hypertrophic, vesicobullous, hypopigmented, cornifying, zosteriform or linear, acute and comedonal subtypes. Comedonal Darier disease is characterized by the coexistence of acne-like comedonal lesions with typical Darier hyperkeratotic papules on light-exposed areas. At histopathologic level, comedonal Darier disease differs from classic Darier disease in the prominent follicular involvement and the presence of greatly elongated dermal villi.

Patients manifest a wide range of clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities, including hypoglycemia, severe hepatomegaly due to excessive accumulation of glycogen, kidney enlargement, growth retardation, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia.
DI-00522	Glycogen storage disease 2	GSD2	A metabolic disorder with a broad clinical spectrum. The severe infantile form, or Pompe disease, presents at birth with massive accumulation of glycogen in muscle, heart and liver. Cardiomyopathy and muscular hypotonia are the cardinal features of this form whose life expectancy is less than two years. The juvenile and adult forms present as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy beginning in the lower limbs. Final outcome depends on respiratory muscle failure. Patients with the adult form can be free of clinical symptoms for most of their life but finally develop a slowly progressive myopathy.
DI-00523	Glycogen storage disease 3	GSD3	A metabolic disorder associated with an accumulation of abnormal glycogen with short outer chains. It is clinically characterized by hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, short stature, and variable myopathy. Glycogen storage disease type 3 includes different forms: GSD type 3A patients lack glycogen debrancher enzyme activity in both liver and muscle, while GSD type 3B patients are enzyme-deficient in liver only. In rare cases, selective loss of only 1 of the 2 debranching activities, glucosidase or transferase, results in GSD type 3C or type 3D, respectively.
DI-00524	Glycogen storage disease 4	GSD4	A metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of an amylopectin-like polysaccharide. The typical clinical manifestation is liver disease of childhood, progressing to lethal hepatic cirrhosis. Most children with this condition die before two years of age. However, the liver disease is not always progressive. No treatment apart from liver transplantation has been found to prevent progression of the disease. There is also a neuromuscular form of glycogen storage disease type 4 that varies in onset (perinatal, congenital, juvenile, or adult) and severity.
DI-00525	Glycogen storage disease 5	GSD5	A metabolic disorder resulting in myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance, cramps, muscle weakness and recurrent myoglobinuria.

Two subtypes are known: type 1 or classic type with no phosphorylase kinase activity in liver or erythrocytes, and type 2 or variant type with no phosphorylase kinase activity in liver, but normal activity in erythrocytes. Unlike other glycogenosis diseases, glycogen storage disease type 9A is generally a benign condition. Patients improve with age and are often asymptomatic as adults. Accurate diagnosis is therefore also of prognostic interest.
DI-00529	Glycogen storage disease 9B	GSD9B	A metabolic disorder characterized by hepatomegaly, only slightly elevated transaminases and plasma lipids, clinical improvement with increasing age, and remarkably no clinical muscle involvement. Biochemical observations suggest that this mild phenotype is caused by an incomplete holoenzyme that lacks the beta subunit, but that may possess residual activity.
DI-00530	Glycogen storage disease 9C	GSD9C	A metabolic disorder manifesting in infancy with hepatomegaly, growth retardation, hypotonia, liver dysfunction, and elevated plasma aminotransferases and lipids. These symptoms improve with age in most cases; however, some patients may develop hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Urinary oligosaccharide levels are high. It leads to death usually between the first and second year of life.
DI-00533	GM1-gangliosidosis 2	GM1G2	A gangliosidosis characterized by onset between ages 1 and 5. The main symptom is locomotor ataxia, ultimately leading to a state of decerebration with epileptic seizures.

DI-02550	Pleuropulmonary blastoma	PPB	A rare pediatric intrathoracic neoplasm. The tumor arises from the lung, pleura, or both, and appears to be purely mesenchymal in phenotype. It lacks malignant epithelial elements, a feature that distinguishes it from the classic adult-type pulmonary blastoma. It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor.

Another skin manifestation is pachyonychia, but alopecia and leukoplakia are distinctively absent. Patients have recurrent pneumonias that usually result in reactive airway disease and/or chronic cough. One of the most important extracutaneous symptoms is an increased susceptibility to infections, mainly affecting the respiratory system, primarily due to a chronic neutropenia and to neutrophil functional defects. Bone marrow abnormalities account for neutropenia and may evolve into myelodysplasia associated with the risk of leukemic transformation. Poikiloderma with neutropenia shows phenotypic overlap with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.

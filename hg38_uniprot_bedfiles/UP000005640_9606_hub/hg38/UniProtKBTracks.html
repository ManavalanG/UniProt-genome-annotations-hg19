<H2>Description</H2>
UniProt is a resource of information on protein sequences and function.<br>
Manual curation of high quality experimental protein data from the literature<br>
describes the role of a protein, and regions or sites of interest such as functional<br>
domains, binding and enzyme active sites, sequence structure, post-translational<br>
modifications and variants associated with disease.<br>
<br>
In order to support the genomics community in the interpretation and exploitation of<br>
the human genome, UniProt provides an up-to-date mapping between specific genomic<br>
sequence coordinates and the corresponding protein sequence annotations.<br><br>

<H2>Methods</H2>
Human protein sequences in the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) have been mapped<br>
to the human reference genome assembly (GRCh38) via the Ensembl resource. For each<br>
protein sequence in UniProtKB the corresponding peptide, transcript and genomic<br>
coordinates in Ensembl are identified. These mappings are updated for each UniProt<br>
release and specific tracks are provided for each UniProt sequence annotation<br>
type e.g. binding site.<br><br>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<H4>Track naming convention</H4>
Each track name consists of a unique proteome identifier followed by the species<br>
NCBI taxonomy identifier and the specific UniProt sequence annotation name.<br> 
For example, for human the UniProt unique proteome identifier is UP000005640<br>
and the NCBI taxonomy identifier is 9606.<br> 
<br>
The list of sequence annotation names and their descriptions are provided below. <br>

<H4>UP000005640_9606_proteome</H4>

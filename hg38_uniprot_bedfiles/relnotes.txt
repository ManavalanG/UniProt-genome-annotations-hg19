Note: The BED formatted files currently do not load as custom tracks in the
UCSC genome browser.  To visualise UniProtKB annotations with the UCSC genome
browser use either the bigbed (.bb) binary compressed versions of the bed files
directly or upload the track definitions from the
<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_tracks.txt file or with the track hub.

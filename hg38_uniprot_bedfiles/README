Universal Protein Resource (UniProt)
====================================


The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt), a collaboration between the European
Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and
the Protein Information Resource (PIR), is comprised of three databases, each
optimized for different uses. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the
central access point for extensively curated protein information, including
function, classification and cross-references. The UniProt Reference Clusters
(UniRef) combine closely related sequences into a single record to speed up
sequence similarity searches. The UniProt Archive (UniParc) is a comprehensive
repository of all protein sequences, consisting only of unique identifiers and
sequences.


Genome annotation tracks
========================

UniProt genome annotation tracks represent the mapping of a species reference
proteome and sequence annotations to the species' reference genome.  The genome
track files provided can be loaded into a genome browser as custom tracks to 
visualise UniProtKB annotations within the genomic context. 

This directory, uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/genome_annotation_tracks/
contains the following directories and files, updated four-weekly:

README (this file)
relnotes.txt
<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_beds/
<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_hub/
<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_tracks.txt


File names:
-----------
- The <UniProt Proteome ID> is the unique identifier of the UniProtKB reference
proteome and the <Taxonomy ID> the corresponding taxonomic identifier.
- relnotes.txt file contains the corresponding species scientific name
<UniProt Proteome ID> and <Taxonomy ID>.


File format:
------------

1. relnotes.txt
A tab delimited file contianing
- Species:
  Name of the source organism.
- UPID:
  The unique identifier of the UniProtKB reference proteome
  (<UniProt Proteome ID>).
- TaxID:
  Taxonomic identifier (<Taxonomy ID>).


2. <UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_<UniProtKB Annotation Type>.bed
A BED detail formatted tab delimited file containing
- Chromosome name.
- Annotation start coordinate on the chromosome.
- Annotation end coordinate on the chromosome.
- UniProtKB accession, BED line name.
- Score set to 0 as default.
- DNA strand +/- for forward or reverse.
- Thick start coordinate on the chromosome.
- Thick end coordinate on the chromosome.
- Annotation color (RGB).
- Number of blocks representing the annotation.
- Block sizes, a comma separated list.
- Block starts, a comma separated list of block offsets relative to the
annotation start.
- Annotation identifier (not available in proteome bed detail file).
- Annotation description (not available in proteome bed detail file).
- Amino acid change (variant bed detail file only).
- Annotation evidence (not available in proteome bed detail file).
Missing values are represented by dots.


Note: The BED formatted files currently do not load as custom tracks in the
UCSC genome browser.  To visualise UniProtKB annotations with the UCSC genome
browser use either the bigbed (.bb) binary compressed versions of the bed files
directly or upload the track definitions from the
<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_tracks.txt file or with the track hub. 

3. <UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_<UniProtKB Annotation Type>.bb
A binary compressed version of the bed detail file.

4. <UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_tracks.txt
Track definitions for each UniProtKB annotation type; defining: genome version,
URL for the annotation big bed file and initial visualisation settings.
Currently only supported by UCSC genome browser.


Directory format:
-----------------

<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_beds/
Contains a bed detail formatted file for each UniProtKB sequence annotation
type.

<UniProt Proteome ID>_<Taxonomy ID>_hub/
This directory contains track hub definition files and a <genome> directory.

Hub files:
----------
hub.txt - track hub definition file
genomes.txt - genome and track database definitions

Hub directory:
--------------
<genome>/  - The genome directory. For example hg38
